Choose a large pot with drainage holes and well-draining potting mix.  Plant it in a sunny location, protecting it from strong winds.  Water regularly, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings.  Bring it indoors during colder months (below 10\u00b0C).  Once established and larger, you may consider planting it outdoors in a sheltered, sunny spot in spring/summer when temperatures are consistently warmer.\n"}], "location": "London", "context": "Last topic: how to plant a neem plant"}

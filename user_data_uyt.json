Choose a sunny spot with well-drained soil.  Dig a hole twice as wide as the root ball.  Gently remove the plant from its container, loosen any circling roots, and place it in the hole. Backfill with soil, water thoroughly, and mulch around the base to retain moisture.  Protect from strong winds, especially when young.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "how to grow a neem plant"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given London's current 19.82\u00b0C and 48% humidity, start your neem tree indoors in a large pot with well-draining soil.  Ensure consistent warmth and bright, indirect sunlight.  Water when the top inch of soil is dry.  Once frost risk has passed (usually late spring/early summer), gradually acclimatize it to outdoor conditions before planting it in a sheltered, sunny spot with well-drained soil.  Protect it from strong winds and harsh frost.\n"}], "location": "London", "context": "Last topic: how to grow a neem plant"}
